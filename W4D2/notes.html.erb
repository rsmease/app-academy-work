<!-- #Views in Rails
  #Views allow us to see HTML and other assets using our app
  #Views are engaged using the render function
  #Views are stored in app/views
  #Views have a file name of controller_name.html.erb
    #We refer to the view via render :view
  #Views are not required to be attached to the model that is governed by the controller; you could build a status page that is independent of the database, but it would be good practice to find a way to lead your users back to the the application
  #Embedded ruby code is stored in tags -->
    <%# not rendered %>
    <%#= will be rendered %>
